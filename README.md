# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Risk Register & Compliance Checklist (NIST CSF-Aligned)

This educational project simulates a full-cycle GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) workflow by combining a **structured cybersecurity risk register**, a **mapped compliance checklist**, and an **organizational accountability framework**. The goal is to demonstrate hands-on application of industry-recognized standards including:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Annex A**
- **CIS Controls v8**

## 📁 Project Files

- `Cybersecurity Risk Management (GRC Portfolio).pdf` – Integrated case study including asset review, risk register, compliance mapping, and staff governance roles  
- `heatmap.png` – Impact vs probability matrix highlighting priority risks  
- `compliance-checklist.md` – Control verification table mapped to risk scenarios R1–R6 *(optional file to include)*

---

## 📊 Risk Register Highlights

- Threat modeling across network assets (routers, switches, databases, servers)  
- Risk scoring using probability × impact matrix  
- Treatment strategies: mitigation, avoidance, and residual risk evaluation  
- Visual heat map placing high-risk items in critical red zones  
- Control maturity and alignment with ISO Annex A, NIST functions, and CIS benchmarks

## 📋 Compliance Controls Validation

Each risk scenario (R1–R6) maps directly to control objectives:
- ✔️ Patch Management (ISO A.12.6.1 / CIS 7)  
- ✔️ Email Security and Anti-Phishing (ISO A.13.2.3 / CIS 9)  
- ✔️ Access Controls (ISO A.9 / CIS 6)  
- ✔️ Insider Threat Monitoring & Protocol Hardening

Checklist includes compliance status, maturity level, and implementation notes.

## 👥 Staff Governance Matrix

Defines GRC-related accountability roles:
- Compliance Officer
- IT Security Lead
- HR/Policy Coordinator
- Audit & Legal Liaison
- PTO Backup Personnel  
Shows how security controls remain effective across absences and shifts.
