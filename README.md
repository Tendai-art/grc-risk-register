# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Risk Register (NIST CSF-Aligned)

This mock cybersecurity project demonstrates the development of a structured risk register aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, and **CIS Controls**. It is designed to showcase hands-on application of risk management principles in a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) context.

## 📁 Project Files
- `Cybersecurity Risk Register Project 1.pdf` – Complete deliverable including asset mapping, threat identification, risk scoring, and treatment strategies
- `heatmap.png` – Color-coded impact vs. probability visualization for prioritized risks

## 🧠 Key Components
- Asset inventory covering routers, servers, switches, and more
- Threat-vulnerability pairing across six risk scenarios
- Risk scoring using impact × probability matrix
- Visual risk heat map (high–medium–low zones)
- Residual risk assessment and treatment strategies (mitigation, avoidance)
- Alignment with international standards and security control best practices

## 📚 Frameworks & Standards Referenced
- **NIST CSF** – Risk functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2013** – Annex A control alignment
- **CIS Controls v8** – Mapped to risk treatments (e.g., access control, patching, phishing mitigation)
